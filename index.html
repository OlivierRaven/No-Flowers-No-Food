    <h1>Biodiversity Crisis: The Urgent Decline of Insects</h1>
    <p class="important">Insects are collapsing—this is a global emergency.</p>
  </header>

    <h2>What’s Happening?</h2>
    <p>Recent research shows that over 40% of insect species are declining, and about a third are endangered :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}. In some untouched nature reserves, flying insect biomass has dropped by 75%, beetle populations in the U.S. have declined sharply, and massive losses in Puerto Rico have been recorded :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</p>
    <p>In the U.S., butterflies are disappearing at a "catastrophic" rate—22% decline over two decades, with over 100 species declining by more than 50% :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Insects are foundational to ecosystems—they pollinate plants, recycle nutrients, control pests, and serve as food for wildlife :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}. Around 75% of global crops rely on insect pollinators, contributing trillions in ecosystem services and food security :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.</p>
    <p>Their decline threatens food webs, agriculture, and even human health—leading to less nutritious crops and disrupted ecosystems :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.</p>

    <h2>What You Can Do—It's Easy!</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Stop mowing and spraying—let nature thrive.</li>
      <li>Allow wildflowers, native plants, and natural ground cover to grow—even in small spaces or lawns.</li>
      <li>Create insect-friendly habitats: add log piles, undisturbed soil, and diverse flora.</li>
      <li>Spread awareness—share these facts and encourage friends to take simple actions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These low-effort steps can make a huge difference—because nature isn’t only in reserves; it’s everywhere.</p>
